            <h1>Call For Speakers Now Open</h1>
            <p>
                We are pleased to announce our call for speakers for DevSpace 2018.
                The form will be available until the 22nd of June.
                Please take a moment to read over this before you submit your masterpieces.
            </p>
            <h2>What we are looking for</h2>
            <p>
                If we were normal, this would be a paragraph about what we're looking for.
                However, we'ren't normal like that.
                This is what I will tell you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Depending on the number of sessions, we'll accept somewhere between 55 and 64 sessions.
                The wobble has to do with the number of 30 minute sessions submitted.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you submit a session, there is one required tag.
                It is a drop-down box that will force you to pick between Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced.
                This is how we define that:
            </p>
            <p>
                Beginner: No prior knowledge of the main topic is required.<br />
                Intermediate: Working knowledge of the main topic is recommended.<br />
                Advanced: Deep knowledge of the main topic is required.
            </p>
            <p>
                After you pick your level, you can add as many or as few tags as you like.
                More tags are good for attendees.
                Less tags are good for selection.
                You should probably aim for about 3.
            </p>
            <h2>How sessions are selected</h2>
            <p>
                We have some golden rules for selecting and scheduling our talks.
                The first 3 have to do with selection.
                The final two deal with scheduling.
            </p>
            <p>
                1: Two talks on the same general topic cannot happen at the same time.<br />
                2: No single general topic, except non-technical (soft skills) talks will available in every session block.<br />
                3: No speaker shall present more than 2 talks.<br />
                4: No speaker will speak more than once on a single day unless the speaker requests to do so.<br />
                5: No talk on the same general topic (including non-technical talks) will be in the same room for consecutive sessions.<br />
            </p>
            <h2>When will we hear back from you?</h2>
            <p>
                If all goes well, The call for speakers will close on the 22th of June.
                We will select the sessions and notify speakers by the 2nd of July.
                We will announce the full session line-up on the site on July 8th.
            </p>
            <h2>What do we give you</h2>
            <p>
                This is always a touchy subject.
                You will always get a full ticket to the conference.
                Unfortunately, that's all I can promise.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm going to be honest here.
                We've never ended a year in the black.
                I'm still paying for last year.
                However, I will say this, giving back to speakers is the FIRST thing we'll do once we clear expenses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having said that, if you need some sort of assistance, please reach out to us.

                If you feel you can't submit because we can't promise full T&E, we completely understand.
            </p>

            <p>
                One final word of warning.
                The submission portal is mad buggy.
                It's a continual work in progress.
